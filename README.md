[BASTA!](https://basta.net/html5-javascript/cross-plattform-workshop/) 2018, 23. Februar 2018, 08:30–16:30 Uhr, Mariott Hotel Frankfurt am Main.

Your trainers: [Christian Liebel](https://twitter.com/chris_liebel), [Manuel Rauber](https://twitter.com/ManuelRauber), [Christian Weyer](https://twitter.com/christianweyer), Thinktecture AG, Karlsruhe.

## Setup

Please follow the instructions found in your participant email first. After that, we kindly ask you to install the required third-party packages at home or any place with a stable internet connection, as hotel WiFis tend to be unreliable.

**NOTE:** Web technologies move fast and quickly. As there might be new releases in the meantime, we strictly recommend you to perform the following installation steps not earlier than one week before our workshop, as we might update the versions in this repository until then.

On your command line, please run:

```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli@1.6.7
```

Next, navigate to a folder of your choice and execute:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thinktecture/basta-spring-2018-xplatform-ws.git
$ cd basta-spring-2018-xplatform-ws
$ npm install
```

Or, if you prefer SSH, use this checkout URL: `git@github.com:thinktecture/basta-spring-2018-xplatform-ws.git`
